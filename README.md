```
You are an expert Angular developer.
Generate code for a library management system with the following specifications:

Pages

Books Page

List of books with Angular Material table.

Pagination included.

Each book has: id, name, and categories.

CRUD operations.

For Create and Update, open a modal (Angular Material Dialog) with a form:

name (text field).

categories (multi-select dropdown populated from Categories).

Categories Page

List of categories with Angular Material table.

Pagination included.

Each category has: id, name.

CRUD operations.

For Create and Update, open a modal with a form:

name (text field).

DTOs

For each entity (Book, Category) generate:

Create DTO.

Update DTO.

Brief DTO (for list view).

Services

Generate Angular services that handle HTTP communication with backend (/api/books and /api/categories).

Include methods for getAll, getById, create, update, and delete.

Routing

Add Angular routes:

/books â†’ BooksPageComponent.

/categories â†’ CategoriesPageComponent.

Design

Use Angular Material for table, pagination, buttons, dialogs, and form controls.

I already installed it in the application. don't install it.

Make UI clean and responsive.

ðŸ“Œ Output should include:

Angular components (BooksPage, CategoriesPage).

Dialog components (BookFormDialog, CategoryFormDialog).

Services.

DTO definitions.

Example routing module updates.

Example module declarations for Material imports.
```
